solved
batch items should have same shape
Feature concatenation in GS-fusion block. Shapes missmatch
Shufflenet is for image classification, need to take features without the last fc layer
find_unused_parameters=True in DDP constructor. unused parameters in shufflenet and lstm block(typo)
metrics

I HAD TO ADD `export PYTHONPATH="/export/home/7alieksi/ba/src"` to .bashrc to run this 

open
shufflenet normalize, input size 224
loss function too close to zero.
wer metric +
rtf metric +
How does real-time work? +
layernorm

dataset lrs3 only from Julius:
train 2 times: 1st with mix and s1 as target speaker, 2nd with mix and s2 as target speaker. s1 is louder as s2.
2 secons gecropped


todo 

AO vs AV compare vs Naive AV
new dataset with interfering speakers
Different SNR
chunk input for real-time 160=10ms=4frames (640 = 40ms = 1 video frame) samples 1 frame
LSTM 100 Hz.

dataset is too complicated
add images in BA (input waveform -> input features -> mask -> applied mask -> out features -> output waveform)
add audios to github and write about it in ba

take shufflenet NOT pretrained
check pad_signal
lsmt check hidden state
check different amount audio/video lsmt block
check loss function: negative si-sdr OR stft with power-law compressed phase-aware (PLCPA)
take default torch stft + PLCPA

BA structure:
